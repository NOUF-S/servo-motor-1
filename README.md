# servo-motor-1
the Control the position of a servo motor with your Arduino and a potentiometer.
# Hardware Required:
Arduino Board
Servo Motor
hook-up wires
Breadboard
potentiometers

# Circuit:
Servo motors have three wires: power, ground, and signal. The power wire is typically red, and should be connected to the 5V pin on the Arduino board. The ground wire is typically black or brown and should be connected to a ground pin on the board. The signal pin is typically yellow, orange or white and should be connected to pin 3 or 5 or 6 or 9 or 10 or 10 or 11 on the board.
Servo motor can be directly connected to Arduino. We connected the motor to the Arduino as shown in:
